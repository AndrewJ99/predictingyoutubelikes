Jupyter Notebook Project
###### Language: Python 
###### Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
###### Algorithms: Random Forest, Linear SVC, ANN-R

##### * Implemented Python libraries Pandas and NumPy, and three regression model algorithms; Random Forest Regression, Linear SVC, and an ANN-R, to predict the number of likes a YouTube video could receive from an array of features in a dataset. 
##### * Manipulated the dataset of over 90,000 rows provided by Kaggle to fit the needs of our regression models, executed One-Hot Encoding on categorial information and pre-processed additional features.
##### * Observed that Random Forest Regression was the best model to use for this specific dataset achieving close to 88% r-squared accuracy comparing the training dataset to our test dataset. 

*NOTE: this repo does not include the test.parquet and train.parquet
